Fisticuffs for Ludum Dare 25 (c)'2012 by schattenkind.net
=========================================================
This game is made for Ludum Dare 25 — December 14th-17th, 2012.

'Fisticuffs' is an ICE HOCKEY brawl game for 2 Players! 

First serve first comes? | Is the luck on your side? | Who knows the winner? 

Fisticuffs is not a real game, but rather a simulation where you can bet for the winning team. 

Pussies are working as team, where dicks are lone wolfs. Dicks are proactive, where pussies are reactive. 

The only thing you can control is the spawning time of your team members. So take care! 

The game has two modes:

1st Gamemode 
------------ 
If you choose to play on keyboard, all team members spawn at their team location. 

2nd Gamemode (advanced mode) 
---------------------------- 
If you choose to play with mouses, you need to connect a second one to your Computer. Players can place thier team members directly on the ice hockey field. Only use your Teams Mouse Button!!! 

Controls 
--------

PUSSIES: 'left-alt' or 'space' or left mouse button 

DICKS: 'rshift' or 'return/enter' or right mouse button
